# Description

    In this assignment, you will write a Command Line Interpreter (CLI) for your operating
    system. Your CLI should prompt the user to enter the input through the keyboard. After a
    sequence of characters is entered followed by a return, the string is parsed and the indicated
    command(s) executed. The user is then again prompted for another command.
    Your program implements some built-in commands; the list of required commands is listed
    below. Do not use exec to implement any of these commands. The exit command is also a
    special case: it should simply cause termination of your program.
    For this assignment, the following are essential features for your work
    1. Your CLI should be written in Java
    2. Your application should contain 2 major classes (Parser, Terminal)
